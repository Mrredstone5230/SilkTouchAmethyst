# SilkTouchAmethyst
This plugin allows budding amethyst to drop with a silk touch item.

The *silktouchamethyst.use* permission is required by default to mine a budded amethyst block with silk touch. If you want to disable this feature, set "usePermission" to "false" in the config file.

Also, the plugin adds a warning message when breaking a budded amethyst block that WONT drop. You can change the message in the config file.
